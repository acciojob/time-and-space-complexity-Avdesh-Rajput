    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, as a function of the length of the input. Analyzing time complexity helps determine how efficient an algorithm is when the size of the input grows.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to complete its execution. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial, especially when working with large datasets or constrained systems. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) requires memory proportional to the input size.
